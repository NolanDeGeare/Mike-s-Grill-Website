# Mike's Grill
This is a GitHub repo. Full stack Website for Mike's Grill

# Instructions for local development

1) Install Maven/Spring Boot

2) Install React

3) To start the backend server, open FullstackGrill/backend in the terminal and run 'mvn spring-boot:run'

4) To start the frontend server, open FullstackGrill/frontend in the terminal and run 'npm start'

5) Open your browser to localhost:3000

6) Explore website. Your frontend changes will automatically recompile and be deployed, so you can work on things and watch it change on the website in real time.

Note that the database is now hosted in the cloud. I have added the connection details to application.properties. We can look at moving those to env variables or to a cloud secrets manager once we decide on a hosting service for the frontend+backend.
